I'll expand the equipment types to include those specific items. Here's a more comprehensive prompt for generating dummy data:
Generate comprehensive test data for an Equipment Hire Management system within an NEC4 construction contract platform, focusing on these specific equipment types:

1. Equipment Categories (include all of these):
   - Piling Hammers
   - Excavators (various sizes)
   - Welding Units
   - Barges
   - Welfare Units
   - Telehandlers
   - Generators
   - Lighting Towers
   - Scaffolding Systems
   - Pumps & Dewatering Equipment
   - Site Accommodation
   - Cranes & Lifting Equipment

2. Equipment Items (minimum 25):
   - Include specific models for each category 
   - For excavators: include mini, midi, and large excavators with tonnage
   - For piling hammers: include different energy classes
   - For welding units: include different amp ratings
   - For barges: include different tonnage capacities
   - For welfare units: include different occupancy sizes
   - For telehandlers: include different reach and load capacities
   - Include properties: id, name, description, category, serial number, status (available, on-hire, maintenance), purchase/manufacturing date, last maintenance date

3. Equipment Suppliers (minimum 8):
   - Include specialist suppliers for each equipment type
   - Include company name, contact person, email, phone, address, account number, supplier type
   - Match with actual suppliers from the system if possible (HeavyLift Plant Hire, ElectroPro Services, etc.)

4. Active Hire Records (minimum 20):
   - Different statuses: active, pending return, overdue, returned
   - Include: equipment id, supplier id, project assignment, hire start date, expected return date, actual return date (where applicable), daily rate, total cost to date
   - Ensure some items are approaching return dates (within 7 days)
   - Include some overdue items (5+ days past expected return)
   - Include UK-specific project locations and site references

5. Off-hire Requests (minimum 15):
   - Different statuses: pending, sent, confirmed
   - Include request date, requested by, notes, confirmation number (where applicable)
   - Include reasons for off-hire (project complete, no longer needed, replacement)

6. Notifications (minimum 10):
   - Types: approaching return date (3/7 days), overdue equipment, maintenance due
   - Include escalation levels, recipient roles, delivery status
   - Include some unread notifications

Format the data in JSON structure appropriate for seeding a database. Ensure data relationships are maintained (e.g., equipment items reference valid categories, hire records reference valid equipment items).

Use realistic UK-based company names, realistic costs based on equipment type (higher daily rates for piling equipment and barges, mid-range for excavators and telehandlers, lower for welfare units), and date ranges within the last 3 months for active hires.
