Improvement Suggestions:
 • 
Event-Driven Architecture: Introduce an internal publish/subscribe or event emitter system for
 agent communication. For example, when the Email Intake Agent parses a new email and
 detects it’s an Early Warning, it could emit an 
earlyWarning.received event with the
 relevant data. The Contract Agent or Early Warning module could subscribe to that event and
 immediately handle creating a new Early Warning record in the database and sending
 notifications. Decoupling agents via events makes the flow more asynchronous and resilient. It
 prevents tight coupling (e.g., Email agent having to directly call functions in other agents) and
 makes it easy to add new agents or actions in response to events without modifying the core
 email processing code. 
Code Example – using Node’s EventEmitter: Suppose we have an 
eventBus instance of EventEmitter.
 After classifying an email: 
import EventEmitter from 'events';
 const eventBus = new EventEmitter();
 // Somewhere in initialization
 eventBus.on('earlyWarning.received', async (ewData) => {
 await EarlyWarningAgent.createEarlyWarning(ewData);
 logger.info(`Early Warning created for project ${ewData.projectId}`);
 });
 eventBus.on('compEvent.notice', async (ceData) => {
 // Contract Agent handles a compensation event notice
 await ContractAgent.registerCompensationEvent(ceData);
 await NotificationService.alertContractManager(ceData);
 });
 // ... other subscriptions ...
 In the Email Intake processing route, after using AI to classify the email: 
// After determining type and extracting data from email
 if (result.classification === 'Early Warning') {
 eventBus.emit('earlyWarning.received', result.data);
 res.status(202).json({ message: 'Early Warning identified. Processing 
initiated.' });
 } else if (result.classification === 'Compensation Event') {
 eventBus.emit('compEvent.notice', result.data);
 res.status(202).json({ message: 'Compensation Event notice identified. 
Processing initiated.' });
 }
 // etc.
 Using events in this way ensures that each agent’s reaction to an event is handled in its own module,
 improving separation of concerns
