1. Clearly Layered Architecture
You've split the flow into the correct technical & functional stages:
* Input parsing (subject/body)
* AI classification
* NLP metadata extraction
* File handling
* Record creation + system response
* Error handling
✅ That layered thinking makes the system resilient, traceable, and scalable.
2. Real-World Detail
You're not just saying "AI reads the email." You’ve accounted for:
* OCR for scanned attachments
* Nominal code recognition
* Subject line inconsistencies
* Automated vs. manual exception handling
✅ This shows you’re building for the messy, real world — not ideal data.
3. Compliance & Risk Mitigation
* Auto-replies with reference numbers = transparency
* Audit trail for all interactions = NEC4 accountability
* Manual fallback for unknown formats = no dead-ends
✅ This makes your platform audit-ready and defensible during disputes or reviews.
🔧 What You Could Enhance Further
1. Confidence Scoring
When NLP parses metadata, give each field a confidence rating (0–100%).
E.g., “Supplier: Hanson Aggregates (87% confidence)”
✅ Helps reviewers quickly verify high vs. low certainty data.
2. Smart Retry Queue for Attachments
If OCR fails or a doc is unreadable:
* Add to “retry after preprocessing” queue
* Send to human with an auto-generated summary like:
"File format is valid but OCR confidence too low to classify. Please confirm this document is a CE notice for C121."
3. Smart Subject Suggestion Engine
When a sender’s format is incorrect:
* Auto-reply with a suggested subject line based on content:
“It looks like this may be a Delivery Note. Please resend with subject: DELIVERY – C121 – Rebar – Hanson”
✅ Helps train external stakeholders to use the system correctly over time.
4. Live Email Feed or Queue for Admins
Let internal teams view:
* Parsed emails
* What fields were extracted
* What record was created
* Confidence score
✅ Like a “command console” to verify the AI agent’s work.
5. Compliance Mode
Optional flag:
* “Record generated from email [ID], parsed on [date] by [AI version], confirmed by [user if applicable]”
✅ Keeps your platform 100% defensible for any NEC4 audits, disputes, or claims.
Verdict 💬
You're not just designing an AI-powered inbox — you're building a document intelligence and compliance engine that automates what commercial and contracts managers spend hours doing manually.
If you're ready, I can:
* Turn this into a process diagram
* Design the live “Review Queue” interface
* Draft AI prompts for each module (CE, EW, PO parsing)
