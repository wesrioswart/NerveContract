Answers to Your Questions
Which processes do you find most time-consuming or error-prone in your current workflow?
Compensation event quotations and assessments (Clauses 62-63) are often the biggest bottlenecks—gathering evidence, calculating impacts, and ensuring prospective (not retrospective) evaluations can take hours or days, especially with manual cross-referencing to programmes. Early warning registers (Clause 15.2) also get neglected, leading to incomplete risk tracking and escalated disputes. Defects notification and correction (Clauses 42-43) are error-prone due to inconsistent reporting formats, resulting in missed deadlines or incomplete audits.
Are there specific templates your team frequently requests or struggles with?
Teams often ask for better quotation templates for compensation events, as the current Compensation Event Notice covers notification but not the full quotation submission/response cycle—users struggle with breakdowns of Defined Cost and assumptions. Programme acceptance/revision templates (Clauses 31-32) are another frequent request, as progress reports exist but lack formal acceptance tracking. Defects-related templates are struggled with for similar reasons: non-conformance reports are there, but users want something more specific for notifications and corrections to avoid ambiguity.
Do you want templates that integrate more deeply with your existing AI agents and approval systems?
Absolutely yes—deep integration is key to the platform's value. For example, templates should auto-populate from AI analyses (e.g., impact calculations from the AsyncScheduleAnalysisAgent) and feed into the approvals dashboard (e.g., auto-flag for HITL review based on confidence thresholds). This would extend our current setup, where AI handles monitoring and proposals, by linking templates directly to P6/MS Project updates and audit trails.
Are there industry-specific templates that would give you a competitive advantage?
Yes, templates tailored to sectors like infrastructure or renewables could differentiate us. For instance, a Weather Delay Certificate (Clause 60.1(13)) with AI weather API integration for forecasts, or a Sustainability Compliance Report (tied to Z-clauses for net-zero requirements). A Subcontractor Instruction Template (Clause 26) would be advantageous for multi-tier supply chains, with AI to check alignment with main contract obligations.
What aspects of template expansion would be most valuable for your platform?
Prioritize modularity and AI automation: Templates that auto-generate content (e.g., clause references, impact simulations) and integrate with workflows (e.g., linking to early warnings or payments). Compliance-focused features like built-in validators and audit exports are crucial for NEC4 users. Scalability for custom Z-clauses and mobile-friendly drafting would add value, as would analytics (e.g., template usage reports to identify bottlenecks).
Refined Suggestions for Additions
Based on these answers, let's prioritize 4-5 additions that build on your foundation without overwhelming the dashboard. I've focused on high-impact ones that address time-consuming processes and integrate with AI/approvals:

Quotation for Compensation Event (Clause 62)
Extends your Compensation Event template; AI auto-fills costs/time from event data, generates Defined Cost breakdowns, and routes for approval.
Accepted Programme / Revision (Clauses 31-32)
Complements Progress Report; AI imports from P6/MS Project, highlights variances, and checks compliance before submission.
Defects Notification / Correction (Clauses 42-43)
Builds on Non-Conformance Report; AI suggests correction timelines and links to site photos/uploads for evidence.
Risk Reduction Meeting Minutes (Clause 16)
For documenting discussions from early warnings; AI generates agendas from registers and tracks actions with reminders.
Final Assessment / Account (Clause 53)
Extends Payment Application; AI reconciles cumulative data and flags unresolved CEs for closure.
These would fit neatly into your grid layout (e.g., add to "Execution and Changes" or "Payments and Closure" rows). If this matches your vision, we can mock up the cards or code stubs— or adjust based on more details! What do you think of this refined list?
