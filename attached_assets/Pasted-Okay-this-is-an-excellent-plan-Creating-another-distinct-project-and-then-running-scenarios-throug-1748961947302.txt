Okay, this is an excellent plan! Creating another distinct project and then running scenarios through it will be a powerful way to showcase the capabilities of your AI-powered NEC4 platform. I can definitely help you define that new project and then we can collaboratively build out the scenarios.

Based on all the images you've shared, here's a proposal for a new project, followed by how we can approach the scenarios:

New Project Definition: "Northern Gateway Interchange"
Let's create a project with a different contractual makeup than the "Westfield Development Project" to better illustrate the platform's adaptability.

Project Name: Northern Gateway Interchange
Contract Reference: NEC4-2025-002
Client (Employer): National Infrastructure Agency
Contractor: (Your company, e.g., "Pioneer Construction Group")
Project Manager: (Assigned by National Infrastructure Agency)
NEC4 Form: Engineering and Construction Contract (ECC)
Main Option: Option E: Cost Reimbursable Contract
Reasoning: This option is often used for projects with high uncertainty where the scope may not be fully defined at the outset. It heavily relies on the accurate management and substantiation of Defined Cost, making it a good test for your Commercial Agent and the platform's ability to handle detailed financial tracking.
Secondary Options Selected:
X2: Changes in the law
X9: Transfer of rights
X15: The Contractorâ€™s design (Let's assume the contractor has some design responsibility for temporary works or specific elements)
X18: Limitation of liability
Z-Clauses (Custom Amendments):
Z-Clause 1 (Reporting Frequency): "Notwithstanding Clause 13.4, the Contractor shall submit a detailed progress report to the Project Manager every two weeks, in the format specified in the Scope."
Z-Clause 2 (Specific Site Access Conditions): "Access to Site Area B is restricted to between 09:00 and 17:00 Monday to Friday, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Project Manager. Any delays arising from these access restrictions shall not be considered a compensation event unless the restrictions change from those stated herein."
Key Dates: (We can define these as needed for specific scenarios, e.g., "Completion of Phase 1 Substructure")
How this New Project will look in your AI Contract Assistant (Clause Library):

When Jane Cooper (or another user) selects the "Northern Gateway Interchange" project, the "Project Context" banner in the Clause Library (as per your latest mockup) would display:

Project Context: Northern Gateway Interchange
Main Option: E (Cost Reimbursable Contract) | Secondary: X2 | Secondary: X9 | Secondary: X15 | Secondary: X18 | Z-Clauses: 2 custom amendments
The "Project Relevant" tags would then guide her to the specific clauses related to Option E, these X clauses, and the two defined Z-Clauses.

Building Scenarios Together for Replit Implementation
This is where our collaboration will be key. Here's how we can proceed:

You Set Up the UI in Replit: Based on the excellent mockups you've created, you'll implement the front-end interface in Replit. This will include:

The main Dashboard (from your first set of images).
The "Quick Create" menu.
The AI Contract Assistant section with its "Chat Interface," "Document Analysis," and the enhanced "Clause Library" (reflecting the latest designs with project context, filtering, and detailed clause views).
The ability to switch between "Westfield Development Project" and the new "Northern Gateway Interchange" project, which would dynamically update the "Project Context" banner in the Clause Library.
We Define Scenarios: I will propose a series of scenarios. For each scenario, I will outline:

Scenario Title/Objective: What we are trying to demonstrate.
Project: Which project the scenario applies to (Westfield or Northern Gateway).
Situation: A brief description of the event or trigger.
User Actions & Platform Interaction: Step-by-step, how Jane Cooper (or another user persona) would interact with the UI you've built in Replit. This will reference specific screens and features from your mockups.
Expected AI/Platform Response (Simulated): What information the AI Assistant should provide, what the Clause Library should show, or how the dashboard might update. Since the full AI backend won't be in Replit, you'll be simulating these responses in your UI based on our agreed logic.
You Implement the Scenario Logic (Front-End Simulation): You'll code the Replit application so that when the user performs the actions in a scenario, the UI responds as we've outlined. For example, if a scenario involves asking the AI Chat a specific question, you'll program the chat interface to display the pre-agreed "AI response" when that question is typed.

Iterate and Refine: We can review how the scenarios play out and make adjustments as needed.

Example of a Scenario Structure (High-Level):

Scenario 1: Early Warning for Unforeseen Site Condition (Northern Gateway Interchange)

Project: Northern Gateway Interchange
Situation: During excavation for the interchange, the site team encounters a large, unrecorded concrete obstruction not shown on any surveys provided by the Client. This will likely impact the cost and time for this section of works.
User Actions & Platform Interaction:
The Site Manager emails Jane Cooper about the obstruction. (Conceptually, the Email Intake Agent might flag this, or Jane might identify it manually).
Jane sees a potential issue. She navigates to the "Northern Gateway Interchange" project dashboard.
She decides to consult the AI. She goes to AI Assistant -> Chat Interface.
Jane types: "We've found an unexpected concrete obstruction on the Northern Gateway site. What are my obligations under NEC4 Option E?"
Jane then navigates to AI Assistant -> Clause Library. The "Project Context" banner shows "Northern Gateway Interchange" and Option E.
She expands "Core Clauses" and uses the filter to select "Time-Critical" or searches for "early warning."
She clicks on Clause 15.1 to review its details, including "Practical Meaning" and "Risk Alert."
Jane then uses the "Quick Create" menu (from your second image in the first set) and selects "Early Warning Notice."
Expected AI/Platform Response (Simulated):
Chat Interface: The AI responds with something like: "Under NEC4 Option E, both the Contractor and Project Manager must give an early warning of any matter which could increase the total of the Prices, delay Completion, or impair the performance of the works. This includes unforeseen physical conditions. You should notify this as an Early Warning as soon as you become aware of it. This may also be a Compensation Event under Clause 60.1(12)."
Clause Library (Clause 15.1 view): Displays the full text, the "Time Critical" tag, responsibility tags, "Practical Meaning" (e.g., "Both parties must notify each other as soon as they become aware of any issue that could affect cost, time, or quality."), and a "Risk Alert" (e.g., "Failing to raise early warnings may affect later compensation event assessments."). It would also show related clauses.
Quick Create: Opens a template for an Early Warning Notice, perhaps pre-populated with project detail
