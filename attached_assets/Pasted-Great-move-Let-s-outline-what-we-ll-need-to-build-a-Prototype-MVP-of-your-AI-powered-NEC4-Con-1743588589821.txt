Great move! Let's outline what we‚Äôll need to build a **Prototype (MVP)** of your AI-powered NEC4 Contract Management platform. We‚Äôll focus on **core functionality**, keeping it lean but impactful.

---

## ‚úÖ **MVP Feature Scope**

### 1. **Login & Role-Based Dashboard**
- Roles: Principal Contractor, Subcontractor, Commercial Manager, QS
- Dashboard shows project status, open items (CEs, NCRs, EWNs), deadlines

---

### 2. **AI Project Assistant (Chat Interface)**
- Use a GPT-powered assistant trained on NEC4 terminology
- Can answer queries like:
  - ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Clause 61.3?‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúWhen is the CE response due?‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúSummarise outstanding EWNs‚Äù
- NLP extracts info from uploaded documents or emails

---

### 3. **Compensation Events Register**
- Submit, track, and respond to CE notifications
- Timeline auto-alerts (submission, quotation, acceptance)
- Audit trail and status tracker

---

### 4. **Early Warning Register**
- Log new EWNs
- Assign responsibility
- Schedule risk-reduction meeting
- AI prompts based on trend detection in site logs

---

### 5. **NCR & TQR Module**
- Raise, view, and close **Non-Conformance Reports**
- Submit and manage **Technical Queries**
- Attach photos/drawings
- AI flags non-compliance from diary/NLP scans

---

### 6. **Programme Sync (Basic)**
- Upload MS Project files (XML/MPP)
- View key milestones
- Track delays linked to CEs or NCRs

---

### 7. **Payment Certificate Generator**
- Submit Payment Applications
- Auto-calculate value based on CEs and progress
- Generate draft assessments for review

---

### 8. **Reporting & Export**
- PDF or Excel exports of:
  - CE summary
  - Risk log
  - Progress vs programme
- Optional Power BI link

## üß± **Tech Stack Recommendation (MVP)**
- **Frontend:** React / Next.js
- **Backend:** Node.js or Python (FastAPI)
- **AI/NLP:** OpenAI GPT or local LLM + LangChain
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Integrations:** MS Project file parser, Power BI API, email parser (IMAP/SMTP)
- **Hosting:** Vercel/Netlify (frontend), AWS/GCP backend

---

## üéØ Next Steps
1. **Wireframes / UI Mockups** (can help with this next)
2. **Define User Stories & Workflows**
3. **Build Clickable Prototype (e.g. Figma or Framer)**
4. **Develop Functional MVP (1-2 core features first)**

---

Would you like to start with:
- A **clickable UI prototype**?
- A **detailed technical build plan**?
- Or both in parallel?

We can begin designing screens for the AI Assistant + CE Register right away if you're ready.
