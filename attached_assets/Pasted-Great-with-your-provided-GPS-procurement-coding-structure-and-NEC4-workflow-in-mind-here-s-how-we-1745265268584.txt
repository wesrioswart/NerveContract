Would you like me to:
1. Design a **React component UI** for this form or list view?
2. Build a **form logic flowchart** for approval and status tracking?
3. Set up a **database schema** recommendation for how to store these coded requisitions?

Youâ€™ve got a great system structure already â€” we can now digitize it beautifully.
