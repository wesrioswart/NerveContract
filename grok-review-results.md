   - Test email intake with real construction emails

2. **Real Document Testing** (2 days)
   - Test with actual NEC4 contracts and variations
   - Validate compensation event detection accuracy
   - Measure early warning generation effectiveness
   - Document classification performance metrics

3. **Core Agent Validation** (1 day)
   - Email Intake Agent: Real email processing accuracy
   - Contract Control Agent: NEC4 compliance validation
   - Commercial Agent: Cost analysis precision
   - End-to-end workflow testing

**Outcome**: Production-ready NEC4 contract management with validated accuracy

### **Option C: Balanced Approach (4-5 days)**
**Best for: Both investor and customer readiness**

**Priority Actions:**
1. **Fix Critical Issues** (4 hours)
2. **Core Functionality Testing** (1.5 days)
