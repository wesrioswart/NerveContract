# Grok AI Test Suite Results

## Overview
Comprehensive testing of Grok 2's advanced capabilities in code analysis, reasoning, and mathematical logic for contract management scenarios.

## Test Categories

### 1. Code Analysis Tests
**Testing Grok's ability to:**
- Detect bugs and security vulnerabilities
- Optimize performance bottlenecks
- Suggest architectural improvements
- Analyze algorithm complexity

**Sample Test: Contract Event Processing Algorithm**
```typescript
class CompensationEventProcessor {
  constructor(private contractType: string) {}

  processEvent(event: any) {
    if (this.contractType === 'NEC4') {
      return this.processNEC4Event(event);
    }
    return this.processGenericEvent(event);
  }

  private processNEC4Event(event: any) {
    const timeLimit = this.getTimeLimit(event.type);
    const isValid = this.validateSubmission(event, timeLimit);
    
    if (!isValid) {
      throw new Error('Invalid submission');
    }
    
    return {
      approved: true,
      value: this.calculateValue(event),
      timeExtension: this.calculateTimeExtension(event)
    };
  }

  private getTimeLimit(eventType: string): number {
    const limits = {
      'variation': 8,
      'ground_conditions': 2,
      'delay': 8
    };
    return limits[eventType] || 8;
  }

  private validateSubmission(event: any, timeLimit: number): boolean {
    const submissionDate = new Date(event.submissionDate);
    const eventDate = new Date(event.eventDate);
    const diffWeeks = Math.ceil((submissionDate.getTime() - eventDate.getTime()) / (7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000));
    
    return diffWeeks <= timeLimit;
  }

  private calculateValue(event: any): number {
    return event.laborCost + event.materialCost + event.equipmentCost;
  }

  private calculateTimeExtension(event: any): number {
    return Math.max(0, event.criticalPathDelay);
  }
}
```

### 2. Reasoning Tests
**Testing Grok's ability to:**
- Analyze complex multi-contract scenarios
- Assess strategic implications and risks
- Provide comprehensive recommendations
- Consider legal and commercial factors

**Sample Test: Multi-Contract Framework Analysis**
A construction project involves three different contract types:
- Main works under NEC4 ECC Option C (target contract with activity schedule)
- Design services under JCT Design and Build 2016
- Specialist subworks under FIDIC Yellow Book 2017

Scenario: Delay due to unforeseen ground conditions with £250,000 additional costs, 6 weeks time extension, and £180,000 acceleration costs.

### 3. Logic & Mathematical Tests
**Testing Grok's ability to:**
- Solve complex probability problems
- Perform risk analysis calculations
- Apply decision tree analysis
- Optimize resource allocation

**Sample Test: Risk Assessment Logic Tree**
Base conditions:
- Weather delays: 40% probability Q1, 20% Q2, 30% Q3
- Ground conditions: 25% probability worse than expected
- Material price inflation: 60% probability exceeding 3%
- Labor availability: 35% probability constrained

With interdependencies and combined impact calculations.
