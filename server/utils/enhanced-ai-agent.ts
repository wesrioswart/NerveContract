For compensation events under NEC4, the key requirements are defined in Clause 60.1. The most relevant sub-clauses for your situation are:

- Clause 60.1(1): The Project Manager changes the Works Information
- Clause 60.1(12): Physical conditions within the working areas which an experienced Contractor would have judged to have such a small chance of occurring

Under Clause 61.1, you must notify compensation events within 8 weeks of becoming aware. The quotation process is governed by Clause 62.2, requiring a revised programme and assessment of time and cost impact.

For your specific project context, this applies to the current Westfield Development where any unforeseen ground conditions or design changes would trigger these procedures.`;
