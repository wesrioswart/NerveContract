# Email Agent Processing Guide

## Overview
The NEC4 platform automatically processes incoming emails to create contract documents, equipment requests, and project communications. Your Outlook account (ai.nec4.test.1234@hotmail.com) is now connected and ready to process emails.

## How It Works
The system monitors your inbox and automatically identifies different types of project emails based on subject lines and content, then creates the appropriate records in your contract management system.

## Supported Email Types

### 1. Equipment Hire Requests
**Subject Format:** `HIRE: [Equipment Type] - Project: [Project Reference] - Equipment ID: [Equipment ID]`

**Email Content Should Include:**
- Equipment specification
- Hire period (start/end dates)

**What Happens:** System creates equipment hire record, generates confirmation, updates project equipment inventory.

### 2. Equipment Off-Hire Requests
**Subject Format:** `OFFHIRE: [Equipment Type] for return - Project: [Project Reference] - Equipment ID: [Equipment ID]`
